Important Graph Problems:
1. Path between s and t ( ES: BFS/DFS ) 
2. Shortest Path between s and t ( ES: BFS ) 
3. connected components ( ES: BFS/DFS )
4. Biconnected Components ( ES: DFS )
5. Is there a cycle in graph ( ES: BFS/DFS )
6. Is a graph bipartite ( ES: BFS/DFS ) 
7. Find a General Cycle that uses every Edge exactly once ( Euler Cycle ) ( ES: DFS )
8. Find a cycle that visits every vertex exactly once ( Hamilton Cycle (Classical NP-complete Problem), also known as traveling salesperson problem )
9. Are two Graphs identical except for vertex names ( Graph Isomorphism )
10. Lay out a graph in the plane without crossing edges ( Linear time DFS algorithm ) ( ES: DFS )


*ES Stands for Efficient solution
