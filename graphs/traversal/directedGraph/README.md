DFS & BFS Applications:
  1. Find all vertices reachable from s along a directed graph
  2. Reachability Applications: 
      1. Program control-flow analysis:
        1. Dead Code Elimination (Find and remove unreachable code) 
        2. 2. Infinite Loop Detection (Determine whether exit is unreachable)
      2. Mark-Sweep Garbage Collector
  3. BFS in Diagraphs Applications: 
     1. Crawl Web
      
TopologicalSort Applications:
  1. Precedence Scheduling
    (Set of tasks to be completed with precedence constraints in which order should we schedule the tasks)
  2. Spreadsheet Recalculation
   
Strongly connected components Applications:
  1. Software Modules Dependency graph:
    1. E.g. firefox, Internet Explorer
